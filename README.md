"The main purpose of the provided code is to encrypt and decrypt files. The application enables users to connect and perform encryption and decryption using the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) or the Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) algorithm. Additionally, the application includes functions for encryption key management, displaying key information, and interacting with a database to store user and key data.

Video demo v1 (without DSA): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-l_qLNu8zA
Video demo v2 (with the addition of the DSA function): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_qOHurGNxY

The project took a long time to complete. If I had more time, I would add other features:

An interface for each profile.
An interface that allows the use of any algorithm; just provide the algorithm, and it will do its job.
Logs to track user connection times.
Automatic updates of the application from a server.
More features to be added.
